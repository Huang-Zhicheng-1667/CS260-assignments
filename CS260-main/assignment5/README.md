Introduction
The purpose of the program: to implement linked list sorting and search functions.
Program implementation: including creation of linked list data structure, element insertion and search operations.

Linked list design and creation
Define the linked list node structure: describe the data and pointer members of the node.
Create a linked list head pointer: initialized to empty.

Element insertion operation
Implement the insertion function: insert new elements into the correct position in the linked list according to the sorted order.
Handle the case of empty linked lists and non-empty linked lists: ensure the correctness of the insertion operation.

Linked list sorting and stability
Determine the sort order: Choose ascending or descending order.
Consider the sorting algorithm: you can choose an algorithm such as a simple insertion sort or a more efficient merge sort.
Ensures the stability of the sorting algorithm: does not change the relative order of equal elements.

Element search operations
Implement the search function: use linear search to find the specified element in the linked list.
Returns the search results: if found, a pointer to the node is returned, otherwise a null pointer is returned.

Main function
Create test cases: define different input data, including sorted and unsorted cases.
Call the insertion function: test the correctness and sorting effect of the element insertion operation.
Call the search function: Test the accuracy and efficiency of the search function.

Array-based List and Linked List:
The program implements both an array-based list and a linked list. The array-based list isn't explicitly provided in the code above, but I'll describe how it could be implemented as well.

Automatic Insertion in Correct Position:
In the linked list implementation, the insertNode function automatically inserts values in the correct position based on ascending order. It traverses the list to find the appropriate position for the new node and inserts it there, maintaining the sorting order.
For the array-based list (not explicitly implemented), when an element is added, it can be inserted using binary search to find the correct position to maintain the sorting order.

Efficient Searching:
For the linked list, the program implements linear search in the search function. Although linear search is not as efficient as binary search, it works well for linked lists, especially when the list is small or unordered.
For the array-based list (not explicitly implemented), binary search can be used for efficient searching. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it efficient for sorted arrays.

Tests in the Main Function:
The main function contains tests for inserting elements into the linked list, printing the list, and searching for a specific value.
It demonstrates how to use the implemented functions (insertNode and search) to manipulate and interact with the linked list.
